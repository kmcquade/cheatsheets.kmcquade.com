# Cheatsheets

Over the years, I've used a **lot** of various Linux commands and clever code snippets. Unfortunately, I was not always good at keeping track of these commands in case I would need them later. I hooked up GitBooks to my personal website so I can stash some cheatsheets here. It's much easier to manage.

These cheatsheets are not meant to be comprehensive lists of various commands and topics. They are only meant to stash the important ones that I use/used regularly or things that took me longer than a few minutes to figure out.

Feel free to copy/paste/steal some of these if you like.



:warning: I go through phases with this cheat sheet. Sometimes I update certain sections frequently, but most sections I haven't updated in years. Don't expect these to be comprehensive.
