# Terminal Config

I used to use Fig terminal, but that was shut down after being acquired by Amazon.

After removing Fig from my computer, it kind of fucked up my zsh config. I'm still using Warp Terminal and I like it, but I have to use iTerm integration with Jetbrains. I'm storing some notes here as I return my Z shell to a working state.



Great blog post about how to configure iTerm with oh my ZSH:
